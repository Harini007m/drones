<p class="ddr"><strong>An unmanned aerial vehicle</strong> (UAV), commonly known as a <em>drone</em>, is an aircraft without any <em>human pilot</em>, crew, or passengers on board.<br>
UAVs were originally developed through the <strong>twentieth century</strong> for <strong>military missions</strong> too "dull, dirty or dangerous"for humans, and by the twenty-first, they had become essential assets to most militaries. <br>
As control technologies improved and costs fell, their use expanded to many <strong>non-military applications.</strong><br>
These include aerial photography, area coverage, precision agriculture, forest fire monitoring, river monitoring, environmental monitoring, policing and surveillance, infrastructure inspections, smuggling, product deliveries, entertainment, and drone racing.<br>

<strong style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif;color:blue">Drone frame or chassis</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif">The frame or chassis is the body of the drone and is the component that serves the function of holding all the parts together. Therefore, each of the parts of a drone are attached to it according to a configuration that allows the UAV to have an excellent aerodynamic performance.
<br>
It functions as the structure of a drone that allows all the components to be assembled and is usually the one that defines the size of the drone.</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif;color:blue">Arms</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif">The arms of a drone are the components that support the motors and are attached to the frame or base structure of the drone. Long arms offer greater stability, while short arms allow for better manoeuvrability. In some cases, the arms are part of the drone’s base structure or frame, so they are not counted as separate parts.</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif;color:blue">Motors</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif">Another element of a drone that is of great importance is the motors. They are the fundamental parts that help keep the drone up and running. The motors of a drone are located at the ends of each of the arms of the frame and are responsible for generating the propulsive force for the drone to soar.</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif;color:blue">Drone propellers</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif">The motors do not have the capacity to lift the drone on their own, as they must be connected to propellers that are in charge of rotating to provide lift to the drone. Therefore, each motor has one or two propellers that together make up the powertrain.
<br>
Most drones have a pair of standard propellers, which rotate counterclockwise, and a pair of reverse propellers. This provides greater stability during flight.</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif;color:blue">Battery</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif">The motors as well as the other electrical and electronic components of the drone need power to operate, which they get from a battery that is located in the frame. There are various types of batteries for drones, although the most common are Li-po batteries, which offer great performance and autonomy in flight.</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif;color:blue">Flight Controller Board</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif">One of the most important parts of a drone is the controller board (not to be confused with the identification plates or number plates of a drone) which acts as the “brain” of the UAV. This drone flight controller is responsible for receiving and recording all the information coming from the controller, the geolocation system, the sensors and other interconnected elements, while sending the necessary signals to control the drone’s movements during flight.
<br>
Other components of great relevance to the control of the drone, such as the compass, gyroscope and sensors, are usually located on this board.</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif;color:blue">Sensors</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif">Although not all drones have the same components, they usually have a number of sensors that are important for the drone’s performance. These include:
<br>
<strong>Speed sensor: </strong>This allows the speed at which the drone is moving to be determined by interpreting the air pressure impacting the device.<br>
<strong>Height and altitude sensors: </strong>these sensors use pressure variation to detect how high the drone is flying in relation to the ground, and its position in relation to sea level. This data is of great importance in order to maintain the maximum altitude at which a drone can fly, in accordance with current EASA drone regulations.<br>
<strong>Position sensors: </strong>these allow the drone’s position to be known in real time, through connectivity with GPS or any other global positioning system.</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif;color:blue">Camera</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif">The camera is one of the most important parts of a drone when used for aerial photography or drone filming. Although not all drones have this element, it is one of the most common accessories, so the body of the drone usually has the necessary structure to install a camera on its base.</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif;color:blue">Gimbal</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif">This part of the drone is essential for stabilising the camera during drone flight. It is a complement that is placed between the frame and the camera, to prevent the vibrations of the motors from affecting the quality of the images captured with the drone.
<br>
This is one of the parts of a drone necessary to make professional aerial recordings, such as those made by our Skycam experts at UMILES Group.</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif;color:blue">Variable Speed Drives or Speed Controllers</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif">Also known as ESC (Electronic Speed Controllers). These components help to improve the flight experience, as they allow you to vary the speed and direction in which the drone moves in a simple way.</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif;color:blue">Drone control station</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif">The control station usually consists of 3 elements or controls of a drone, including the radio transmitter and receiver, the data management components and the remote control. The remote control is one of the components that you will need to familiarise yourself with when you are learning how to fly a drone for the first time, as it will be the one that allows you to control the drone precisely.</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif;color:blue">Landing gear</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif">This is one of the most important parts to ensure the integrity of the drone when it comes into contact with the ground. The landing gear is a structure that goes on the bottom of the drone, which allows you to maintain an adequate distance between the body of the drone and the ground. This is essential for drones that carry some kind of suspended load, such as a camera, an irrigation system, spraying or any other complement that is required to execute the main uses of professional drones.</p>
<br>
<strong style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif;color:blue">Add-ons</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:18px;line-height:20px;font-family:serif">There are other types of parts of a drone that are not commonly installed in the UAV, but are incorporated additionally depending on the activity to be carried out. Such is the case of cargo drones or drones used to perform light shows with drones, to which add-ons are installed to allow the activity to be carried out normally.
<br>
All of these parts are fundamental to the design of a drone and allow the pilot to control every aspect of the flight safely.</p>
